# maximum-clique

## To find Maximum Clique using Preferential Attachment based on Ant Colony Optimization.

Repository contains the project report for a program that I wrote for my major project during engineering school.

In this paper, a link prediction method using preferential attachment based on the ant colony optimization is proposed. 

This was the final project for the course 'Complex Systems and Networks' during my Master's program at University of Cincinnati.

Please reach out to me for the source-code and I shall share the same.
